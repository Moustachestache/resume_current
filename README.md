# Maxime JOCHUM <br /><sup>junior developer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxime-jochum/"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/noEWd53.png" height="20px"/></sup></a>

### ü©≥ in short
Graduated from the **42Network** branch in Southern France, after a 20 months cursus, with an academic focus on **C**, **C++** and a **Django** / **Javascript** web-stack..
<br/>Our [graduating project ](https://github.com/TimothyREMY/ft_transcendance) is a pong-like web-based game implemented from the ground up with a modern tech stack, a responsive UI and thought-out UX, as well and a websocket and an API for the backend.
<br/>Before this, I taught english in world recognized ESL (english as a second language) schools.
<br/>I was lucky enough to work in France, Portugal, Ireland, Switzerland and Ukraine.
<br/>Teaching was very formative, and taught me many soft skills that are relevant in my IT career.
<br />I speak English and French, and a sprinkle of Ukrainian[^1].

## School Projects:
### Transcendance [<sup>[repo]</sup>](https://github.com/TimothyREMY/ft_transcendance)
A single page web application where users can play pong against one another, take part in tournaments.
<br />Several things were implemented as part of the discovery based learning:
<br />ELK (Elasticsearch, Kibana and Logstash) for logging and log management, a websocket to manage real-time gameplay (both in 1v1 and Tournament games), OAuth registration and connection with our school's API, responsive frontend implementation with Bootstrap (allowing for extended browser compatibility) and support on most devices (apple watch not included).
<br />The main tech-stack is comprised of Python (Django), Javascript (vanilla with the Mythril wrapper) and PostgreSQL.

### Webserver [<sup>[repo]</sup>](https://github.com/Moustachestache/webserv)
An HTTP server developped in C++98. it services GET, POST and DELETE requests.
<br />We are able to upload anything to it, and we can pass POST or GET data to the CGI.
<br />There is a basic version of cookies that stores a username for a session.

### CUB3D [<sup>[repo]</sup>](https://github.com/Moustachestache/cub3d)
A wolfenstein-like lite, where we had to code a ray caster from the ground up.
<br />To add to the learning experience, decided to add a couple of extra things:
<br />Animated textures, doors that open and close, an FPS counter that can display a graph, basic collision, and a minimap.

### Minishell [<sup>[repo]</sup>](https://github.com/Moustachestache/42minishell)
Our own emulation of Shell.
<br />Despite the headache that this problem can be, we found that it taught us a lot about the shell environment and how it is used.
<br />We find ourselves to now be pretty confident shell users.

### more ...
[fdf](https://github.com/Moustachestache/fdf) Wireframe render of a simple 2.5D map.
<br />[push swap](https://github.com/Moustachestache/push_swap) Sorting stacks and discovering sorting algorithms.
<br />[philosopher](https://github.com/Moustachestache/philosophers) "Solving" the dining philosophers' problem.
<br />[libft](https://github.com/Moustachestache/libft) Re-coding our own library of functions.
<br />[printf](https://github.com/Moustachestache/ft_printf) Re-coding printf and discovering variadic functions.

<!--
Ozymandias
I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,

And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read,
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed,

And on the pedestal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, Ye Mighty, and despair!'

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
The lone and level sands stretch far away."
-->
