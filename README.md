### ðŸ©³ in short 
Graduated from the **42Network** branch in Southern France, after a 20 months cursus, with an academic focus on **C** and **C++**.
<br/>Our [graduating project ](#soon)is a pong-like web-based game implemented with a modern tech stack.
<br/>Before this, I taught english in world recognized ESL (english as a second language) schools.
<br/>I was lucky enough to work in France, Portugal, Ireland, Switzerland and Ukraine.

<!--
Ozymandias
I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,

And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read,
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed,

And on the pedestal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, Ye Mighty, and despair!'

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
The lone and level sands stretch far away."
